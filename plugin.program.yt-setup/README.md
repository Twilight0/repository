About
-----
Youtube Setup addon lets you easily apply your created keys inside Kodi and main Youtube addon.


How to use it:
---------------------
First, get your own keys by reading [this post](https://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=267160&pid=2299960#pid2299960).

Then create a text file to load it locally or use a service like [pastebin.com](http://www.pastebin.com/)

See file.txt `and` file.xml in examples directory, you can use either of the two formats, whichever looks more logical.

file.txt looks like this:

file.xml has the info in xml tags already, so pretty self explanatory:
